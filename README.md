## The Problem

Freelancers, small business owners, and early-stage startups typically track their business performance across spreadsheets, invoices, and disconnected tools. There's no single place that gives them a clear, real-time view of how their business is doing.

The result is guesswork — decisions made without clarity.

---

## The Solution

Pulse is a business intelligence dashboard that consolidates the metrics that matter most into one clean interface. Revenue, client count, pending invoices, overdue payments — all visible at a glance, with an AI layer that turns those numbers into a single actionable insight.

## Features

### Core Dashboard
- **4 live KPI cards** — Total Revenue, Active Clients, Total Orders, and Pending Amount — all calculated in real time from your transaction data
- **Revenue Overview chart** — Line chart comparing paid vs pending transactions grouped by month
- **Revenue Split chart** — Doughnut chart showing the breakdown of paid, pending, and overdue amounts
- **Monthly Goal tracker** — Animated progress bar tracking revenue against a user-defined target
- **Notification badge** — Automatically counts overdue transactions and surfaces them in the topbar

### Transactions
- **Add transactions** via a modal form — client name, project, amount, date, and status
- **Delete transactions** with a single click
- **Filter by status** — All, Paid, Pending, Overdue
- **Live search** — filters the table by client name or project as you type
- **Export to CSV** — download all transaction data as a spreadsheet
- **localStorage persistence** — data survives page refreshes and browser restarts

### AI Business Pulse

## Design Decisions

**No framework.** This project didn't need one. Vanilla JS keeps the codebase lean, fast, and genuinely readable. It also demonstrates solid fundamentals — a much stronger signal than spinning up a Create React App boilerplate.

**Mobile-first CSS.** Base styles are written for mobile. Complexity is added progressively with `min-width` media queries. This is the industry standard approach, not the exception.

**Data computed from transactions.** Every metric on the dashboard — revenue, client count, orders, pending amount — is calculated directly from the transaction array. There's no separate hardcoded data layer. Add a transaction and the entire dashboard updates.

**CDN dependencies.** Chart.js and Google Fonts load from CDN. Both are globally cached, production-grade, and faster than self-hosting for a project of this type.

**localStorage over a backend.** This is a frontend demonstration. In a production product, the transaction data would come from a backend API connected to a real database. localStorage provides a realistic "it works" experience without the overhead of a server.

open index.html
```

Or simply open `index.html` directly in any browser.

## What I Learned

- How to architect a multi-page single-file application without a router library
- How to compute derived state — building metrics from a single source of truth rather than maintaining separate data
- How to integrate a real AI API and handle loading states, errors, and fallbacks gracefully
- How to write mobile-first CSS that actually works across all device sizes
- How to use localStorage as a lightweight persistence layer for a frontend-only application
